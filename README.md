# RPG Fighter!

Play it here: https://glacian22.github.io/RPG-Fighter/

This is a game using a basic RPG combat system. You select a character, and then have to battle each of the others, with the strategy revolving around choosing your opponents in the correct order. Watch out for the mage, she's a glass canon!

While the original specs said to give each character a counter-attack stat separate from their attack stat, I decided to keep those two unified.

## Technologies

The layout was made using Bootstrap 4.3, with the logic and most of the visual effects running on jQuery. Some of the visuals are purely CSS.

## TODO
Add more animations, and possibly more attack options to build a more complicated game, as this is essentially a test run.
